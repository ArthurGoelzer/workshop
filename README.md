# Workshop

## Overview
This project is a personal endeavor built using **Rust** and **JavaScript**, leveraging the **Tauri** framework. It is designed to control various custom-built equipment, including:

- Kilns
- Tube Furnaces
- Chemical reactors
- Hydrogen cells (isotope separators)
- (In the future) Nuclear reactors

The application is tailored to run on desktop platforms and features an interface inspired by the **Winbox** app from MikroTik, complete with its own window manager embedded within the app.

The system connects to equipment via both **local network** and a **custom LoRa interface**.

## Features
- **Cross-platform compatibility** via Tauri.
- **Custom-built window manager** to streamline multitasking within the application.
- **Scalable design** to accommodate future equipment integrations.

## Future Plans
- Add support for nuclear reactor control.
- Enhance the user interface with more customization options.
- Integrate additional communication protocols for various equipment.

## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by **Winbox** from MikroTik for UI design ideas.
